# VAK MVP — COMPLETE DESIGN LIST

**Vak AI Technologies · March 2026 · Confidential**

---

## MODULE 1 — TARGET INGESTION SYSTEM

### 1.1 Path A — Structured Input
- [ ] Receive Capability Target Document in standard format
- [ ] Parse fields: clusters, proficiency levels, mastery thresholds, priority, time window, evidence type
- [ ] Map incoming cluster labels to internal learning structure at runtime (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Handle taxonomy changes without code change (reads from document)

### 1.2 Path B — Any Format Input
- [ ] Accept: curriculum document, JD, skills list, competency matrix, government framework, plain text
- [ ] AI extraction of capability intent: what skills, what proficiency level, what timeline
- [ ] Structure extracted targets into internal format
- [ ] Return confirmation summary to institution BEFORE instruction begins
- [ ] Confirmation mandatory — no silent misinterpretation
- [ ] Human-assisted at MVP stage; AI automation in next release

### 1.3 Pathway Design
- [ ] Decompose each cluster into ordered skill nodes (micro-skill graph)
- [ ] Foundational nodes precede applied nodes
- [ ] Prerequisite relationships respected
- [ ] Difficulty progression set against target proficiency level
- [ ] Pathway is Vak's internal operating plan — not shared with institution

---

## MODULE 2 — INSTRUCTION ENGINE

### 2.1 Native-Language Construction
- [ ] Explanations constructed FROM SCRATCH in Hindi or Telugu
- [ ] NOT translated from English — generation process begins in target language
- [ ] Culturally familiar entry point selected for each learner profile
- [ ] English technical term introduced ONLY AFTER concept understood in native language
- [ ] Quality test: concept transfers without English support

### 2.2 Adaptive Branching
- [ ] ADVANCE decision: mastery check passes threshold — move to next node
- [ ] LOOP decision: mastery check fails — new approach, not same explanation
- [ ] 5 explanation approaches available per node: native_concept, analogy, worked_example, decomposition, simplified
- [ ] Loop count logged per node per learner
- [ ] High loop count = signal about explanation architecture, not learner failure
- [ ] No hard loop limit at MVP — continues until mastery confirmed

### 2.3 Explanation Approaches
| Approach | Description |
|---|---|
| native_concept | Build from culturally familiar native-language entry point |
| analogy | One powerful everyday analogy from learner's actual life |
| worked_example | Complete worked example BEFORE abstract concept |
| decomposition | Identify and teach missing prerequisite micro-skill |
| simplified | Strip to minimum, one concept, rebuild from scratch |

### 2.4 Session Management
- [ ] Session started per learner per skill node
- [ ] Full conversation history maintained per session
- [ ] Session logged internally (proprietary — not shared)
- [ ] Active instruction time tracked (minutes, not calendar time)
- [ ] New session created for each loop with new approach

---

## MODULE 3 — MASTERY CHECK SYSTEM

### 3.1 Check Design
- [ ] Applied question or micro-task — learner USES concept, not recalls it
- [ ] Scenario-based: "here is situation Y, how would you use X?" not "what is X?"
- [ ] Check in native language (Hindi or Telugu)
- [ ] AI evaluates quality of understanding, not keyword matching

### 3.2 Scoring Rubric
| Score | Meaning | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 0.90–1.00 | Confident, correct application | ADVANCE |
| 0.70–0.89 | Understanding with minor gaps | ADVANCE (log gaps) |
| 0.50–0.69 | Partial understanding | LOOP with targeted correction |
| 0.00–0.49 | Fundamental misunderstanding | LOOP from different angle |

**Threshold: ≥ 0.70 = ADVANCE. < 0.70 = LOOP.**

### 3.3 Check Integrity Rule
- [ ] Advancement must be conditioned on response QUALITY, not submission
- [ ] ANY response without demonstrated understanding = LOOP
- [ ] Check number logged per node
- [ ] All check results stored for mastery attainment calculation

---

## MODULE 4 — MASTERY LOG PRODUCTION

### 4.1 Field Specification
| Field | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| learner_reference | Always populated | Shared |
| capability_target_document_reference | Always populated | Vak |
| cluster_covered | Always populated (institution's labels) | Vak produces |
| skill_node | Always populated | Vak (proprietary) |
| mastery_attainment (%) | Always populated | Vak (proprietary) |
| time_to_mastery_minutes | Always populated | Vak (proprietary) |
| attempt_count | Always populated | Vak (proprietary) |
| confidence_indicator | Always populated | Vak (proprietary) |
| simulation_readiness_flag | Always populated | Vak signal |
| **readiness_classification** | **ALWAYS BLANK** | **Institution only** |
| **external_score** | **ALWAYS BLANK** | **Assessment platform only** |

### 4.2 Calculation Logic
- **Mastery Attainment**: Recency-weighted average of check scores (more recent checks weighted higher)
- **Confidence Indicator**: Combination of pass rate, loop penalty, and score consistency (stability measure, not readiness)
- **Simulation Readiness**: Binary flag — all nodes mastered + avg mastery ≥ 75% + avg confidence ≥ 60%

### 4.3 Boundary Statement
Every Mastery Log includes: *"This Mastery Log records capability movement and instruction evidence only. Readiness classification and external scoring are owned by the commissioning institution and are not populated by Vak AI Technologies under any circumstances."*

## MODULE 5 — INSTITUTION PORTAL

### 5.1 Onboarding
- [ ] Institution registration with type classification
- [ ] Contact details, city (Hyderabad default)
- [ ] JWT authentication (7-day tokens)

### 5.2 Learner Management
- [ ] Add individual learners (name, ref number, language, profile type)
- [ ] Bulk import via JSON array
- [ ] Language assignment per learner (Hindi or Telugu)
- [ ] Learner reference is institution's own ID

### 5.3 Engagement Management
- [ ] Create engagement against confirmed capability target
- [ ] Assign learner cohort to engagement
- [ ] View cohort progress (current node, nodes mastered, status)
- [ ] Engagement ID visible for learner login distribution
- [ ] Produce Mastery Logs on completion
- [ ] Download/view structured Mastery Log per learner

### 5.4 Dashboard
- [ ] List of all engagements with status
- [ ] Learner count, completion count per engagement
- [ ] Quick actions: upload target, start engagement

---

## MODULE 6 — LEARNER PORTAL

### 6.1 Authentication
- [ ] Login via learner reference number + engagement ID
- [ ] No password required at MVP (ref + engagement = sufficient)
- [ ] Language set at institution level, confirmed at login

- [ ] Active engagement count
- [ ] Mastery logs produced
- [ ] Sessions total, checks passed/failed
- [ ] Average mastery attainment
- [ ] Average loop count

### 8.2 Quality Reports
- [ ] Node difficulty ranking (by avg_attempts) — high = explanation architecture issue
- [ ] Approach effectiveness (which approaches used most, avg loops per approach)
- [ ] Time-to-mastery by node type
- [ ] Confidence indicator distribution
- [ ] Loop frequency by cluster
